    <h3 id="h3secondindex">1971 – 1980</h3>
<p id="pfirstindex"><b>The hippie movement was still the fashion look of late 1960s London, but this did not inspire Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, they were more interested in rebellion and in particular 1950s clothing, music and memorabilia.
    Vivienne began by making Teddy Boy clothes for McLaren and in 1971 they opened Let it Rock at 430 Kings Road.
   
    The collapse of the Sex Pistols and the absorption of Punk into the mainstream left Westwood disenchanted. In 1980 the shop was refitted and renamed Worlds End, the name still in use today.</b></p>

    THE EARLY YEARS<br>
    1981 – 1987</h3>
<p id="pfirstindex"><b>The Pirate Collection of 1981 was Westwood and McLaren’s first catwalk show. This offered a romantic look which burst onto the London fashion scene and ensured this collection’s place in history.
    ‘We’ve only stopped to note significant innovations, otherwise the ideas carry through and develop throughout the collections.’ Pirates, AW 1981-82, first catwalk show. – Plundering history and the Third World. – Research into historical dress, keeping the original cuts as fashion. – Inspiration from Native Americans. Ethnic cuts. – Pirate trousers had a baggy bum/complete contrast to hippy hipsters and tight arse.</b></p>

        THE PAGAN YEARS<br>
        1988 – 1992</h3>
    <p id="pfirstindex"><b>During this period Vivienne’s heros changed from punks and ragamuffins to ‘Tatler’ girls wearing clothes that parodied the upper class. A chance encounter inspired one of her most important and influential collections, the Harris Tweed collection of Autumn/Winter 1987.“My whole idea for this collection was stolen from a little girl I saw on the tube one day. She couldn’t have been more than 14. She had a little plaited bun, a Harris Tweed jacket and a bag with a pair of ballet shoes in it. She looked so cool and composed standing there.”
        Collections: Harris Tweed, AW 1987 – 88 – Tailored and childish look inspired by Royal Family continued. – Inspiration: British fabrics, especially wool which had provided all the uniforms of the British Empire. Black velvet.</b></p>

        ANGLOMANIA<br>
        1993 – 1999</h3>
    <p id="pfirstindex"><b>Vivienne believes that fashion is a combination and exchange of ideas between France and England; “On the English side we have tailoring and an easy charm, on the French side that solidity of design and proportion that comes from never being satisfied because something can always be done to make it better, more refined.”
        Collections: Grand Hotel, SS 1993 Anglomania, AW 1993-94 – At the time of Gainsborough the French became mad about English tailoring and the spontaneity of country charm. – Vivienne believes that fashion is a combination and exchange of ideas between France and England, “On the English side we have tailoring and an easy charm, on the French side that solidity of design and proportion that comes from never being satisfied because something can always become more refined.” Café Society, SS 1994 – The hourglass figure began here with a bustle provided by a cushion. – By the time of ‘Café Society’ the volume of the gowns and their trains had reached maximum proportions due to collaboration with Andreas Kronthaler. On Liberty, AW 1994-95 Erotic Zones, SS 1995 Vive la Cocotte, AW 1995-96 – We have now arrived at a brand new silhouette, the ultimate hourglass figure with padded bust and bustle now constructed out of a light weight metal cage.

    <p id="psecondindex"><b>
        Beginning to put historicism to one side, Westwood returned to a more asexual cut, exploring the natural dynamic of the fabric by treating it like a living mass.
        <br><br>
         – The choice of title explains the forte of Vivienne’s original cutting techniques. A combination of flou and tailoring.
